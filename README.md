Architecture
---
- The backend uses the Python Flask framework, coupled with the uWSGI middleware, and is deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker.
  - uWSGI communicates with Nginx via socket using the uwsgi protocol and calls the Flask app using the wsgi protocol.
  - When a client sends a request, Nginx first handles static resources, and then forwards the remaining requests to uWSGI for processing.
- Other AWS Services
  - ElastiCache Redis: store tokens and related data for member registration, improving performance.
  - RDS MySQL: store all data required by the application.
  - S3: store member avatar images and accelerated read speeds through CloudFront CDN.
  - CloudFront: utilizes its global node CDN service to provide fast file loading speeds, improving user experience.
